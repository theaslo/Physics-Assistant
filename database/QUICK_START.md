# Physics Knowledge Graph - Quick Start Guide

## Overview
This knowledge graph contains 262+ nodes and 698+ relationships representing comprehensive physics education content optimized for Graph RAG applications.

## Quick Setup (Production)

1. **Start Neo4j Database**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run --name neo4j-physics \
       -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
       -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/physics_graph_password_2024 \
       neo4j:latest
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install neo4j==5.14.1 python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Neo4j credentials
   ```

4. **Create Knowledge Graph**
   ```bash
   python physics_knowledge_graph.py
   ```

5. **Validate Graph**
   ```bash
   python validate_knowledge_graph.py
   ```

6. **Test RAG Queries**
   ```bash
   python rag_query_patterns.py
   ```

## Quick Test (Development)

If you don't have Neo4j installed, you can test the structure:

```bash
python test_knowledge_graph_structure.py
```

This creates a mock knowledge graph and validates the structure meets all requirements.

## Integration with RAG Applications

### Basic Concept Retrieval
```python
from rag_query_patterns import PhysicsRAGQueries

rag = PhysicsRAGQueries()
context = rag.get_concept_context_for_rag("Force")
# Returns comprehensive context for concept including formulas, problems, prerequisites
```

### Learning Path Generation
```python
learning_path = rag.get_learning_path("Mechanics Fundamentals")
# Returns ordered sequence of concepts with educational content
```

### Personalized Recommendations
```python
suggestions = rag.get_personalized_learning_suggestions("intermediate", "energy")
# Returns appropriate next topics based on student level
```

## Graph Schema Summary

- **Domains**: mechanics, waves_oscillations, thermodynamics, electromagnetism
- **Concepts**: 133 physics concepts with difficulty levels and learning objectives  
- **Problems**: 37 solved problems across all domains
- **Formulas**: 32 mathematical expressions with variable explanations
- **Explanations**: 31 conceptual explanations for deeper understanding

## Key Relationship Types

- `PREREQUISITE_FOR`: Learning dependencies
- `RELATED_TO`: Conceptual connections  
- `HAS_FORMULA`: Mathematical relationships
- `HAS_PROBLEM`: Practice problems
- `CONTAINS`: Hierarchical organization

## Success Metrics
